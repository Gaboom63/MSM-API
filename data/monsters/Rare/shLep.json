This Rare Dreamythical would appear to be the result of the Oasis Mythical practicing lucid dreaming techniques, in which the dreamer maintains awareness of their dreaming state and can influence the dream environment. Recalling the first time that the being that inspired shLep was encountered, the Oasis Mythical has refocused and reframed that memory as a more relaxing experience, morphing the unusual Monster into a (slightly) more graceful version of itself. Curlers, bows, makeup and mouthwatering bonbons have been integrated into this visual presentation, but when the time comes to begin performing - well, that abdomen-shaking is just as clamorous and emphatic as ever.",
