    "description": "Stubby horns and buckteeth aside, Rare Reedlings are mostly known for their impatience and not being the greatest listeners. Of course, that may have something to do with the fact that they have an extra set of breathing spines in place of ears. To communicate with it, this stubborn subspecies insists that other Monsters pipe musical messages directly into its ear-spines, believing that if something is worth saying, it's worth taking the time to translate.",
