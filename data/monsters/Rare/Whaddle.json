    "description": "You may know that the crooning of a Whaddle sounds sweeter and softer than marshmallow. But did you know that the Rare Whaddle, in pale marshmallow-white, actually has spongy spots that squish just like the sweet treat? Shockingly, these poke-a-dots are not named for Rare Whaddle's talent for dancing the polka, but rather for their velvety texture. This dancing Rare IS a polka master, though, using its pronged ears to dance with two partners at once.",
