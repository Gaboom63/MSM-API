    "description": "Common Cybops might idolize the Ethereal Jellbilly, but the Rare Cybop is no such admirer! It stalwartly marches (or hovers) to the beat of a different drum, transfiguring its mechanical body to match ancient cave drawings of early Cybops. Non-conformity comes with a price, though: the jostling of its twin engines sometimes results in motion sickness, hence its greenish complexion.",
