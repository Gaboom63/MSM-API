    "description": "Most Monsters would trade an arm and a leg for a chance to improve their performance skills... the Rare Whisp seems to have done the opposite and grown some! Or maybe all Whisps have limbs tucked under their flowing, dress-like bodies and only the Rares choose to let it all hang out? Either way, these Rarethereals are convinced their elongated bodies give their singing range a boost... but in truth, their Common cousins seem just as talented.",
