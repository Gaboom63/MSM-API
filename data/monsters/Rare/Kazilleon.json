    "description": "The winged Rare Kazilleon differs from the Common variety in that the exhaust it emits is inoffensive, non-toxic, and smells rather like Moonjube Upside-Down Cake (with a dollop of Lillypilly Cream). These colorful fumes purportedly soothe fussy babies and can curl a fellow monster's fur or tentacles into luxurious spirals within seconds of exposure. Up for anything, this intrepid Rarethereal has seen and done everything there is to see and 'doo-wop!.",
