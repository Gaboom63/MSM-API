    "description": "1 in every 55 Yawstriches is born with a specific genetic mutation that produces radically different-colored plumage and converts their avian wings into insectoid ones. Rather than feeling self-conscious about what sets it apart, this Rare Mythical celebrates its differences and leans into it - perhaps even going overboard! It styles elaborate feather-dos by burying its head in sand, and allows Yucka seedpods to take root on its body and grow a miniature ecosystem on its back. Gotta love it when Monsters embrace their weirdness.",
