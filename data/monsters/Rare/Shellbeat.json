    "description": "Finally - the Rare Shellbeat has been revealed! This especially bashful being only emerges once in a blue moon, so great care must be taken to make sure it feels welcome among its fellow Monsters. Once it's settled in a jam session, the Rare Shellbeat has been known to produce pearls of exceptional quality from its unique shell, which it gives away as presents! This curious Quad-Element often contemplates the nature of the Monster World, and the possibility of alternate universes. If it's learned anything, it has so far decided to keep the secrets to itself.",
