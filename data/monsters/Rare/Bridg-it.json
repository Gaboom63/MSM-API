    "description": "You may be familiar with divergent evolution, but have you ever heard of aspirational evolution? That's what the Rare Bridg-it has undergone, a series of pre-emptive adaptions to an environment... that may never actually come to be! The Magical sub-species swapped its earth tones for greens and blues in the hope that Faerie Island would one day transform into a swampy terrain. It even transfigured its glowing, crystalline 'chinstrument' into horn-like growths to be less conspicuous in the 'swamp' - but for the time being, it stands out more than ever!",
