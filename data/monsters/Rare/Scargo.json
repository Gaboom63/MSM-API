    "description": "Nobody is sure whether the constant collision of the Scargo's clash cymbal-tipped eye-stalks causes it any discomfort, or if the Wublin has just gotten used to it. What is sure is that this Monster's technique is near-perfection - many new percussionists can't seem to get a handle on the proper grip.
