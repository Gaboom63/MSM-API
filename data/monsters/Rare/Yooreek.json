    "description": "Rare Yooreek's steadfastness and support of its friends can come off as a little single-minded at times, which can be troublesome as no one is sure where its mind is located yet. One sometimes has to wonder if Rare Yooreek is all there. Attached at the hip to its good buddy Rare Gaddzooks, this Rarethereal sure likes to go with the flow. But is that so bad?
