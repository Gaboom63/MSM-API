    "description": "Rare Boskus has an ambitious entrepreneurial spirit and a brain always bubbling up with new ideas. This bright Rare firmly believes in putting its best hoof forward - especially during its pitches to other Monsters! To look its best, Rare Boskus regularly pampers itself with a flashy nosey-pedi. Its manicured nasal digit looks particularly striking when it's turning the pages of its jam-packed notepad, or pointing out the key features in its latest presentation.",
