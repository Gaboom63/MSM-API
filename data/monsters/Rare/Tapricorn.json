    "name": "Rare Tapricorn",
    "description": "The Rare form of the Magical Tapricorn is not to be trifled with - it is possessed of various fantastical abilities the likes of which mere mortals may only dream. Rather than sticks, the Rare Tapricorn sources its own horns (it grows three instead of the Common's singular horn) to make its Morse-like music. These instruments have the power to remove impurities from water and cure headaches, simply by being tapped with one! These Rare Magicals feel most at home in the woodland realm... provided that the trees are composed of brain-like tissue and tentacles, of course.",
