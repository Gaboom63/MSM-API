    "description": "Rare Sporerow is so deeply in tune with nature, its appearance reflects the state of the biomes it embodies: in fallow fields or tainted bogs, its wooded body sits cold and hollow, while in healthy forests it is aglow from the inside out! Perhaps this is a reflection of the Air Rare Mythical's own association with the miniature ecosystem it grows on its back! Lively Rare Sporerows also attract Kodamamites, tiny spirits that only appear when in vibrant and well-cared-for environments. Fortunately, Kodamamites are a fairly common sighting, given that the Monster World is so eco-friendly!",
