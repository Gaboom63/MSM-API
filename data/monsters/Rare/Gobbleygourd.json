    "description": "All Gobbleygourds are aeronautically challenged - any time you might have seen one hurtling through the air, it probably just jumped from a high height and hoped for the best. That hasn't stopped one particular rafter of Gobbleygourds from trying to improve their chances by any means possible - losing their snoods, evolving white head feathers to emulate the aquiline ideal and studying textbooks on flight dynamics. It's all wishful thinking, of course - but Rare Gobbleygourds are possessed of an indomitable will that isn't easily discouraged!",
