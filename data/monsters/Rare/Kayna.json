Their intricate, tattoo-like carvings are bestowed upon them with great honor to represent their impressive age and growing wisdom, eon after eon; you can imagine that the oldest Rare Kaynas are quite a sight! Yet no matter how old the original Fire Rare gets, the burning glow of the Fire Element never dims.",
