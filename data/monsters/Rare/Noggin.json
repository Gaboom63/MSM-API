    "description": "After scouring the Monster World for what felt like forever, the Rare Noggin has been unearthed. Not satisfied with a simple existence as a musical rock, this capricious creature reinvented itself as the building block of an exotic edifice. Because of their limited maneuverability, it's unclear whether a group of Rare Noggins could ever actually cooperate to build anything... perhaps a more down-to-Earth goal would be to just keep the rhythm for its fellow Monsters.",
