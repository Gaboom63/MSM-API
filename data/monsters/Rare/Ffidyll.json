    "description": "Monsters are naturally superstitious creatures, and perhaps none moreso than the Rare Ffidyll. In a departure from the carefree, fun-loving disposition of its Common cousin, this Monster is on the skittish side, and constantly on the lookout for any bad luck that may befall it. It's also a believer in the power of 'opposites' holding sway over one's fortunes - so while it can be coaxed out of hiding during Cloverspell, the Rare Ffidyll is actually most at ease at the opposite end of the calendar around the autumnal equinox.",
