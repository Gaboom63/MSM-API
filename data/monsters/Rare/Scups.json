    "description": "The Rare Scups' bioluminescent spurs are perfectly suited to its predominantly noctural [sic] lifestyle. Sure, it performs along nonchalantly during the day, but it's total mystery what it does after the sun sets. Every once in a while, a company of ambitious Monsters will resolve to stay up long enough to witness a Rare Scups in nighttime action, but the siren song of the Castle's beds always proves too much to resist.",
