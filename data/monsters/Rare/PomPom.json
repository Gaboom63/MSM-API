    "description": "There's no greater living proof that 'You are what you eat' than the Rare PomPom. Although sometimes confused for a separate Monster entirely, like the Hoola, this Rare is actually just a Common PomPom on a diet consisting entirely of indigo foods! The change isn't just reflected in its appearance, though - Rare PomPoms develop a heightened fashion sense, and coif their plumes in radical styles - with some blue highlights for good measure.",
