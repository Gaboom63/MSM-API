    "description": "It's amazing what some extra appendages and fins can do! You wouldn't know it to look at it, but the Rare Pummel is exceptionally aerodynamic and uses its extra arms to perform spectacular acrobatic feats. In addition to its two dorsal fins, the tiny growths that cover its body are actually small 'drag-fins' that can open and close to help it maneuver while flipping and flopping about.",
