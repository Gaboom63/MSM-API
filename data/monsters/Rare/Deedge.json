    "description": "Rare Deedges are so handy! They've got a knack for invention, and relish every opportunity to take something apart and put it back together again in a completely different way. Miraculously, the objects they recraft still work, even after reassembly! Such is the case with their state-of-the-art gilded amp sets, which blast out beats just as well as Common Deedges' regular ice(boom)boxes. Just goes to show that there's more than one way to skin a Stritch.",
