    "description": "It is well-documented in tomes of Monster botany that the Common Barrb's neck foliage blooms only in the night; but what happens when a Barrb is never exposed to direct sunlight? It blooms uncontrollably! Rare Barrbs have adapted to subterranean living by undergoing umbrasynthesis: the process of converting raw darkness into valuable nutrients. Who would have guessed a life underground would produce such bright blossoms?.",
