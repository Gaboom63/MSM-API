    "description": "Rare Edamimis represent such a radical departure in terms of both appearance and disposition from their Common relatives that Monsters more often refer to them as 'Gloomy Blooms.' A verdurous veneer? Replaced by atramentous armature. A bright, sunny attitude? Replaced by snide cynicism. Like other Rares in the Plant family, these Fire Monsters process the darkness through umbrasynthesis... and it appears that the side-effects are more than skin-deep. They're stupendous dancers though - even if they're full of woe.",
