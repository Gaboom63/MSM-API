    "description": "Don't get beaned or bamboozled into thinking that the wind is what causes Edamimi's gentle melodic swaying; its undulations are as deliberate as they are hypnotic. Being somewhat of a prankster as a sprout, this Monster has spread its roots and grown a fresh perspective on life. Even though growing up can sometimes be a bum-pea ride, Edamimi can't help but 'photo-sympathize' with the growing pains of fellow plant-based Monsters. Vowing to turn over a new leaf before any friendships have soiled, this rap-scallion still loves to party sh-allot, but now it's all about 'good chives' only!",
