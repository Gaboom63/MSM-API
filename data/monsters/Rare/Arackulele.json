    "description": "What do you get when the soul of a gastronome goes knap-sacking in an arthropod's body? Why, none other than the Rare Arackulele! Upon discovering that its instrument could double as a whisk, this musical epicurean saw fit to whip up such treats as scrumptious saffron syllabubs - all in about the time it takes to strum along to the Ethereal song! In its spare time, it enjoys crocheting toupees for the hairless neighbors of its island home.",
