    "description": "Trying to get a Ghazt is akin to catching smoke with your hands. So you can imagine that trying to get your hands on a Rare Ghazt is like trying to catch a particular puff of smoke that floats by once in a blue moon, with your hands... while blindfolded. This centaurine 'Rarethereal' is the crowning jewel of any Monster collection.",
