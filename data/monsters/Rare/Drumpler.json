    "description": "Endowed with a tall, sloping forehead, it would have been easy for the Rare Drumpler to feel insecure about its hairline, especially when compared to the full-bodied mane of the Common Monster. Unfazed, this positive percussionist instead decided to make the most of the situation and grew two extra sets of eyes! Its appetite is notorious, since its eyes are now truly bigger than its stomach.",
