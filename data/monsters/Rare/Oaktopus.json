    "description": "Much can be said for the Common Oaktopus' powerful tentacles, but when it comes to fine motor skills, that's where the Rares have the upper hand... literally! A pair of nimble tentilla is used to explore the world around them and groom their blond silks. Rare Oaktopi are perhaps a little too wily for their own good, and experiment with various slimes and oozes to brew potent potions.",
