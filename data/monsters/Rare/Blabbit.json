    "description": "What do you do when you have the urge to steal - ahem, borrow - Monster eggs and paint them, but your fellow Monsters are wise to your hijinks? Do as the Rare Blabbit does: get organized. It's not unusual for this mustard-colored creature to be the mastermind behind fearless and inventive egg raids. It's also an expert at covering its tracks; its serpentine form leaves none to speak of! The Rare Blabbit's antics take some getting used to, but it assures us we'll soon learn to appreciate it.",
