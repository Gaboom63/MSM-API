    "description": "Ask anyone in the living ocean for their impression of Rare Bowhead, and they will all tell you the same thing: the Rare Water Top Boss is pure eye candy! Rare Bowhead is not shy about its vanity; to the Monster, a well-groomed appearance is an essential part of the unforgettable shows it performs for its adoring audiences. The Rare Quint's beauty ritual begins with a 7-step haircare routine to ensure its mane is marshmallowy soft; then it pampers itself with a fetching manicure, baleen whitening treatments and a final powdering of its bulbous melon. Showtime!",
