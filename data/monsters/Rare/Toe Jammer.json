    "description": "To call the Rare Toe Jammer a marshmallow enthusiast would be a profound understatement. It gobbles them up at every opportunity, but thanks to a curious chemical reaction that takes place inside the Monster, they drift to its outer membrane and protrude at all angles. The Rare Toe Jammer's shifting coloration may be a product of this same internal process, but while some believe that this theory holds Water, others claim it's just a phase.",
