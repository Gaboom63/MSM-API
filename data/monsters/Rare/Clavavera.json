    "description": "Passing on to the afterlife doesn't have to be a solemn affair, especially if you celebrate the Beat Hereafter! The eminently stylish Rare Clavavera shares its Common cousin's musical ability to tap into the heartbeat of forever and allow Monsters to commune with their ancestors. Unique to the Rare, however, is a special interest in writing short, witty verses that poke light-hearted fun at those same ancestors. It's believed that not taking oneself too seriously is the secret to happiness in any lifetime, and composing these 'Clavaveras literarias' (as they're known) is an important tradition to uphold!",
