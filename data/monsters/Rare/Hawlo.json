    "description": "Living so far underground has its downsides, and one of those is seldom (if ever) seeing the sky. The striped subspecies of Hawlo, seeking to make the dimly-lit ambience of Bone Island more comfortable for all Monsters, crafts its disguise from the Azurewood tree. Staring at the grain of the wood produces a mesmerizing effect that mimics the actual blue sky far above, but staring too long induces a suggestible, hypnotic state in some. Best enjoyed in moderation.",
