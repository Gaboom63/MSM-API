    "description": "Folklore contends that all Strombonin can move soundlessly if they so choose (although most of the time they are deafeningly loud). In reality, this is a misrepresentation of the Rare Strombonin's ability to make itself unseen by camouflaging itself among Piney Trees. By no means is this Rare Mythical prone to quietude - on the contrary, it often occupies a special position in Strombonin society called the Yippie Kiyay-koo. This designated performer will signal with a fewer-eyed Strombone subspecies called the Hora-guy and carried in a webbed net, and you can bet there's no mistaking when it arrives!",
