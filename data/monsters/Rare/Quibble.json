    "description": "Some Quibbles flat out refuse to grow up – in fact, it's one of the few things the two heads can agree upon. Rare Quibbles, who naturally retain the short, stout beaks of their youth, really commit: they preen their crests into radical feather-dos and never replace the colorful keyboards they played as hatchlings. They do need to use beak extenders to reach the rocks... but whatever, man. Still totally hardcore.",
