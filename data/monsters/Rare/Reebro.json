    "description": "Rare Reebros make up the most gifted part of this Ethereal's population. As such, they are concerned - nay, obssessed - with protecting their intellect, using fortified helmets and stronger-than-average mech suits. These 'Bros' are particularly interested in journeying beyond the confines of the Monster World and exploring the multiverse... especially to investigate legends of a cosmic island from ancient times.",
