    "name": "Rare Theremind",
    "description": "Science tells us that one day, we might be able to shed our physical forms and exist solely in our minds... but Rare Theremind may have gotten a little 'ahead' of itself. The well-intentioned but overly-ambitious Rare of this species attempted to speed up its evolution, outgrow its body, and live via astral projection. This endeavor was only half-successful, and the Monster was forced to resume occupancy of its former body with a little help from some Magical reanimation. A lesson to us all to exercise both our minds and our bodies.",
