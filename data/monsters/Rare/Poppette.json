Some Poppettes long so deeply for popp-ularity, they turn to desperate measures: self-experimentation! After much splicing, swabbing and sampling, Rare Poppettes have discovered a method to artificially stimulate accelerated bubble growth. This unsightly practice is generally frowned upon, particularly in the world of Competitive Bubble-Bopping, but it does not stop Rare Poppettes from being welcomed into the coveted social circles they have eyed for so long.",
