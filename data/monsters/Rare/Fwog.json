    "description": "Rotten luck for a Fwog if a Rare specimen surfaces in its territory. Whereas the Common Fwog aspires to attract a mate by song alone, the Rare invariably gets all the attention, with its spiraling horns and resplendently-colored head growths. The absence of the middle eye proves to be quite the hindrance, however; it must compensate with a heightened sense of smell (hence its nose), and of touch (via its hollow, prehensile toes).",
