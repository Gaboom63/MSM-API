    "description": "The rare fuchsia color phase of the Furcorn is truly a sight to behold. Like the more common green Plant-Cold hybrid, its silky pelt is cold to the touch, but not unpleasantly so - sort of like the cold side of a pillow! Unique to the Rare Furcorn, however, is the exotic flower that tips its headstalk - its shape evokes a lovely little bow.",
