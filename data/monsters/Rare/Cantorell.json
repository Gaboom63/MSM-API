    "description": "The Rare Cantorell loves love! It takes its species's yearning for closeness to the next level, growing in tight-knit choirs that sap all nutrients from the soil and leave their bodies a fleshy pink hue. The Rare Magical's craving for cuddles has even caused its mycelium tendrils to grow upwards and outwards, reaching out to others in the choir for a comforting hug. Rare Cantorell choirs can even end up so intertwined that, when seen from above, their 'rings' in fact appear heart-shaped.",
