    "description": "The tusked Rare Zynth is sometimes considered a pest, owing to its penchant for digging up crops and using the energy from its glowing abdomen to dissolve them into a nutritious goo for later consumption. It's not ill-intentioned - it was just designed that way. A word of advice from the Monster-Handlers: keep these creatures away from farms.",
