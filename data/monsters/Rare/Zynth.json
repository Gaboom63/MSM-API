    "description": "The Zynth thrives on the natural electricity emitted by Wublin Island. This Monster stores the excess energy to power its glowing abdomen and produce a wonderful harmonic buzzing sound. A word of caution - don't stand too close to the Zynth, unless you want to reek of the orange fizz and ozone smell that accompanies it wherever it goes.",
