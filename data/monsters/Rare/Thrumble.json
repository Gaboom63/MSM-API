    "name": "Rare Thrumble",
    "description": "Countless accounts in Monster history describe sightings of strange sea creatures - no, we're not talking about Glubbers! In fact, many describe the Thrumble, often mistaken for beasts of the deep. So just what happens when a Thrumble embraces its Watery side instead of trudging about the Earth for centuries? It adapts. Rare Thrumbles are built for hydrodynamics, with sleek fins that grant it increased grace and speed. To maintain peak performance and prevent accidental snagging of Ocean-dwelling vegetation, these Rares file their horns thrice daily.",
