    "description": "The Epic Phangler is one big exercise in contradictions. It has a predilection for elocution (no, not electrocution, ELOCUTION, they're different), and has converted one of its escae into a pop filter-like organ. That would be helpful... if Phanglers ever uttered plosives as part of their performance, but they only ever use nasal syllables! The Double-Element Fire Monster has all the makings of a benthic beast, lurking deep near the bottom of the living ocean - but like its sun-worshipping Rare cousin, it prefers to stay near the water's surface in the epipelagic zone. Finally, you'd think the Monster's eye placement and number would correlate with advanced eyesight - but they are actually a limiting factor in its ability to see, confirming the Epic Phangler to only be able to perceive violet light (so they can identify each other). Such an odd Monster!",
