    "name": "Epic G'joob",
    "description": "In search of musical inspiration, uninspired G'joobs sometimes take to a section of the living ocean called the Sea of G'reen, diving deep in their yellow submarines. There, in the tepid darkness, they finally slip into a slumber of Epic proportions. Once Common, these G'joobs awaken as newly enlightened Epics capable of seeing the Monster World through a fresh eye. The Epic Mythical's flowing beard is grown during its long repose. Each silky strand represents a sweet dream long forgotten, yet the warm and fuzzy feelings of these golden slumbers still linger.",
