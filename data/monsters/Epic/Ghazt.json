    "description": "If Ghazts are known for their ability to slide inconspicuously between dimensions, then the fearsome-looking Epic Ghazts are known for their difficulty in living up to that reputation. The Epic Ethereal possesses several traits that make interdimensional travel a bother: a bad-to-the-bone skeleton that seldom attains full intangibility, dual-ended horns that catch on the edge of dimensional portals, and optical Plasmic orbs that get easily distracted. When it finally settles in to a habitat it finds comfortable, you'd be hard-pressed to flush out this hardheaded Monster!",
