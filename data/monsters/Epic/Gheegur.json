    "description": "The custom of crafting and gifting stuffed animals is a timed-honored tradition, dating back to the days of the Dawn of Fire. Those ones usually weren't possessed by a rambunctious Wublin spirit, however - this Epic attempt to cutesify the Gheegur can be considered successful IF and only if you subscribe to Supernatural design sensibilities. Then, it's head and shoulders above the others.",
