    "description": "Life finds a way, but sometimes it's not supposed to. The basic template for the Incisaur's saurian body plan has been tweaked in its Epic form, but all evidence suggests that this is not a product of evolution. It's not even a freak mutation! The Epic Incisaur is strongly suspected to be the product of deliberate genetic tampering - and recently, to boot! Grafting pterosaur wings onto a raptor-like body could only be considered the work of a madMon, but the identity of this tamperer remains unknown. An ingenious Colossal with aspirations to harness chaos theory? A Titan so preoccupied with whether or not it could that it didn't stop to think if it should? And extra-torustrial interloper looking to make their mark in the Monster World? No one's sure, but at the very least, this crested and furthered Fire Epic has its manners intact: it always remembers to say the magic word!",
