    "description": "Epic Clambles have the sinister countenance of a fearsome villain, all spikes and wrought iron, locked in a perpetual battle with a virtuous knight. In truth, this feudal roleplaying is just that: a play! When not engaged in theatrical LARP-ing, Epic Clambles enjoy quiet time in the garden - though pruning the withering foliage on the scorching Earth Island has cursed this Epic with a blistering bouquet of claw boils.",
