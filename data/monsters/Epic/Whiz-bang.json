    "name": "Epic Whiz-bang",
    "description": "The stellar Epic Whiz-bang is known to showcase more sophisticated artistic sensibilities than its Common and Rare relatives, favoring moody shades and impressionistic strokes for its SkyPainting displays. These stylistic selections are linked to the synesthetic properties of its mythical third eye, which interprets light, color and sound into indescribable spectacles beyond human imagination. Produced by the revered artist Whiz-whent Bang-gogh, the most influential oeuvre ever created by an Epic Whiz-bang is titled Starry Flight. It hangs to this day in the impressive Museum of Monster Art.",
