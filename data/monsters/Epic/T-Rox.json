    "description": "Inspired by their Ethereal neighbors' impressive mech suits, a collection of clever Air Island T-Roxes put their heads together to build upon their own mechanical aspects. After much tinkering and occasional consultations with their brainy mentors, these tech-savvy T-Roxes crafted exoskeletons so advanced, they bonded with their organic components. The resulting cyborg is packed with exciting features: a scratch-resistant dome, built-in nightlights, and even a pair of foot-vacuums for tidying up after lunchtime.",
