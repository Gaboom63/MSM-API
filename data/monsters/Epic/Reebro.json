    "description": "What is the ultimate aim of artificial intelligence, if not for a 'Mech' contraption to blend in seamlessly with the world of 'orga' lifeforms? That's the lofty aspirational goal that Epic Reebros, a hyper-intelligent, 'Monsa' Select think tank of the cranial Ethereals, have set for their mech suits. Leveraging teachings from the dawn of the Monster World that only recently re-entered the cultural consciousness, their plan was to reverse-engineer the technique and invert it to lend a more organic air to their mechanical bodies. Was the experiment a success? Yes and no, which only made the scientific curiosity of these Epic Ethereals pique to new heights!",
