    "description": "Yikes! The Epic Entbrat is a truly terrifying sight for anyone familiar with its hearty Common cousin. No need for alarm, however - we can assure you that this Epic is in a perfectly healthy state. It may be pale, frail, and honestly a little creepy, but this is simply the appearance of a Monster that prefers the comforting darkness of a Cozee Cabin to the shining rays of the great outdoors.",
