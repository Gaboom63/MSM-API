    "description": "The unsightly Epic Oaktopus has been infected with a parasitic pathogen known as the RitRawt. This foul fronded fungus burrows into the trunks of unsuspecting Oaktopi and slowly gains control of their mind and body, causing unusual growths and a smell like moldy fruit. Monsters infected by the RitRawt are known to exhibit an increased need to boogie down.",
