    "description": "True nobility comes with the most popped of collars. Epic Clackula sometimes makes outrageous claims, like how it invented the Excla-monster mark or how the hexagon is the best shape. Because it has such good manners, the other monsters are happy to let it slide, since Epic Clackula's mollusk-like appendages grow only the finest of pearlescent bobbles that it gifts to Monsters who play along with its claims. Its osseous eye-stalks allow it to keep a 360 degree view of its surroundings to make sure it's always aware of surrounding fanciness!",
