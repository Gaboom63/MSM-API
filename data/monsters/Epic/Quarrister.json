The seasoned Epic Quarrister has been one with the Earth for so long that vegetation has begun to take root within its weathered form, changing the landscape of this once-formidable golem forever. Ever the optimists, Epic Quarrister's heads can't help but smile at its new buttercup-yellow blooms and dignified Bawnzi Tree. Well, MOST of its heads.",
