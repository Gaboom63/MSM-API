    "description": "They say that happiness is living in a neat mess, and the Epic Blipsqueak is nothing if not neat when it comes to organizing its various eyes, ears, nose and toes (albeit in unexpected locations). With a body made out of exquisite wood and fine metal ornamentation, this Epic Wublin's knowledge of natural remedies like poultices, tinctures and ointments is unmatched - all thanks to the apothecary diaries it routinely drafts and publishes.",
