    "description": "Wimmzies are a bubbly chorus of Monsters positively bursting at the seams with delight. It's this very overflowing of glee that is cause for the sorority of singers' patchwork appearance: their delicately-sewn casings contain the fine mist that makes up the Wimmzies' upper bodies! Little more than fluttering eyelashes and tapping toes, this squad is nonetheless erupting with joy and - of course - whimsy.",
