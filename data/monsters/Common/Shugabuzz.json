    "description": "The Shugabuzz is the most eccentric of the Shugafam, mainly reflected in its unusual choice of instrument. Other peculiar traits include its facial fur stylings, and a diet of almost exclusively saggle nuts (which everyone else says taste like rocks and give its limbs their smoky-purple coloration).",
