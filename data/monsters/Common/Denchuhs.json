    "description": "The pint-sized Denchuhs are a lot like a pair of your grandaddy's dentures: they're at their best when they're together, but often fall out! Occasional spats are an inevitability when looks are so identical, yet personalities are more contrary than fire and ice: gabby versus glum, sanguine versus stoic, and bubbly versus been-there-done-that. But at the end of a long day, all these little Denchuhs want is a hefty snack in their mega-mouths and the comfort of a held hand.",
