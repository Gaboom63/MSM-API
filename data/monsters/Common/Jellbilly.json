    "description": "This rootin'-tootin' Ethereal is something of a legend to the scavenging Cybops of the neighboring dimension. Their cycloptic vision and distinctive vocal twang are modeled after the Jellbilly's own. Even though they may never meet face-to-face, Jellbillies generously return every piece of Cybop fan mail they receive, taking advantage of their many tentacles to write several replies at once.",
