    "description": "Glaishur's rebirth has given it a perspective on life that is as new and bright as freshly fallen snow. The cheerfully chill Celestial is embracing its newfound joie de vivre by taking up a creative hobby: snow sculpture! Many of this frosty giant's oeuvres are meticulously sculpted in the image of the Cold Elementals who revere it, but these Monsterpieces do not last long. Once a sculpture is complete, it is then toppled and molded anew, representing an eternal circle of life.",
