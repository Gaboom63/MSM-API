    "description": "It was perhaps inevitable that somewhere populated with Fire Monsters (and their connection to Relics) would eventually draw the attention of a Werdo. What was less expected was that it would be a Werdo species not previously recorded in Monster World history! The Mysterious Werdo is renowned for its expansive vocabulary and generosity of spirit, and its inspirational counterpart in the human world has long been a friend of the Singing Monsters. You many even recognize vocal stylings reminiscent of the "Mysterious Werdo" in various Tunes in the Colossingum's Jukebox!",
