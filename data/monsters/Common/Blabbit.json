    "name": "Blabbit",
    "description": "The playful Blabbit shares a common ancestor with the Reedling, and developed an equally eccentric adaptation for breathing - blowing bubbles! As it releases the bubbles, it makes an adorable trilling sound which endears it to the other Monsters. This is lucky for the Blabbit, because it also has a reputation for being a bit of a nuisance when it 'borrows' Monster eggs to paint and hide all over the place.",
