    "name": "Auglur",
    "description": "The Auglur leans heavily into its Mech-Element parentage, and blurs the line between the real and virtual worlds by manifesting a trio of hands with digital digits. You don't need augmented reality goggles to see them; the Auglur's power makes them visible to all. From there, it's a simple matter of gesturing and swiping in mid-air at 'sonic panels' that create soundscapes drawn from nostalgic dreams. Alright, maybe it's not actually so simple for you or I [sic] - but to the Auglur, it comes naturally… er, Ethereally.",
