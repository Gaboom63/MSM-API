    "description": "The wise Jeeode is renowned for its ability to see all sides of a situation. Harnessing the Ethereal power of Crystal, it pictures each scenario as sitting in the center of a giant prism, looking at each facet one at a time. Then, it somehow creates a solution that leaves everyone smiling. Because of this refined perspective, Jeeodes are first-rate instrumentalists, never missing a note.",
