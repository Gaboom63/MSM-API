    "description": "The Cantorell may seem to be a rather small-statured Monster to the naked eye, but beneath the soil, this fungal fiend grows a far-reaching system of mycelia capable of propagating dozens of clones! As more and more like-minded Cantorell caps emerge from the earth, they often compete for space both physical and musical. It's not uncommon to spot a Cantorell choir growing in a ring-like shape, so that each cap can feel included.",
