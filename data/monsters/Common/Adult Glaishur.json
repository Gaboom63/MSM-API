    "description": "Even though many Celestials endure some level of awkwardness in adulthood, Glaishur doesn't appear to be one of them. Sure, it's grown in size a bit and its snow-encrusted fists don't leave a ton of room for finesse... but for the most part, the Celestial of Cold exudes the same even-temperedness throughout its whole life. Perhaps the prevailing sense of 'coolness' is the source of its zen approach - after all, what's cooler than being cool? Ice cold.",
