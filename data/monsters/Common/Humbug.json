    "description": "The Humbug is the incarnation of the misunderstood Ethereal element of Poison. When it buzzes its wings fast enough, it can open up and glide on supersonic dimensional highways from universe to universe. Humbugs naturally enjoy warm weather, and are drawn to humid places where the hum produced by their wings has the finest tone.",
