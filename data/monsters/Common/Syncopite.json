The rugged Celestial has a surprisingly magnetic personality, capable of uniting its fellow Monsters and forging rock-solid friendships. Unfortunately, this inherent magnetism can be troublesome for the mineralized Monster, whose thoughts are frequently interrupted by the sudden collision of stones against its crystalline cranium.",
