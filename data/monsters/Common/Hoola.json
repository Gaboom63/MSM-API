    "description": "Often mistaken for a PomPom that has expanded its traditional diet of exclusively red foods, the Hoola is actually a distinct creature. This doesn't stop them from getting along famously, and they share something of a sisterly bond. The Hoola is a born troublemaker, pulling pranks on other Monsters and using its special hoop to get up to all kinds of mischief. Luckily, a PomPom is usually nearby to help set things right.",
