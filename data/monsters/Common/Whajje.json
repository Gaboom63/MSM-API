    "description": "For a Wublin, the Whajje is almost... dainty. Named for its distinctive 'Whajje-Whajje' cry, it can most often be found standing on tippy-toes so that its song rings out above the heads of other Monsters. Whajjes scrupulously preen their feathers to create a sort of dish to amplify the sound of their voices. Other Supernaturals are always daring it to join their capers, but the Whajje is better-behaved than most - a trait for which it cryptically credits its furry feet.",
