The understated sapling that the Bonkers thump their fuzzy heads against is no Great Tree, but hey - theyll take what they can get! It still emanates a particular magic that compels Bonkers to beat up on bark. While certainly befuddling to us, this behavior is only natural to the other inhabitants of the Bonkers percussive home dimension.",
