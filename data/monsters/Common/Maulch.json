    "name": "Maulch",
    "description": "Sometimes referred to as a 'Clodyawper,' the Maulch is a mound of potting soil with a pronounced underbite. Its vocalizations suggest it gargles with ballast and sandpaper for fun. Its berries - should one be so foolish as to sample them - taste like cinnamon mayonnaise mixed with ham cola and profound regret. The leaf-like appendage atop its noggin acts as a handy parasol, protecting it from inclement weather and some of the more peculiar atmospheric emissions endemic to Wublin Island. It's easily startled by hiccups and denim hats.",
