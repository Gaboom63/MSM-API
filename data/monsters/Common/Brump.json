    "description": "Eww. Almost unique among Wublins, this Monster's appearance definitely brings to mind the eggs used to wake it... and also elicits a gag reflex. The Brump uses its Furcorn-like headstalks and Fwoggy feet to forage for food. It's pretty nasty, but presumably like you, we just can't seem to look away.",
