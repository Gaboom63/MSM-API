    "description": "It takes a lot of strength training to hold up Sooza's humongous horn - how else do you think it got those calves? But like any well-balanced Monster, Sooza's physical strength doesn't hold a candle to the robust heart that its friends know so well. Sooza is always prepared to drop everything (except its horn) so it can listen to a Monster in need and lift their spirits.",
