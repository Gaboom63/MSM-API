    "description": "Gob's gaping gabber leaves gandering groups gobsmacked. An unassuming figure at first blush, a withdrawn Gob might not even appear as a Monster to the untrained eye. But keener onlookers may note the subtle wiggle of its frill before suddenly, it happens: The Aperture Overture! Gob opens wide to release a moving melody that resonates from deep within its internal organs themselves... pipes, pedals, and all.",
