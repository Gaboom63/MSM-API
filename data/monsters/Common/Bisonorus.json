    "description": "It takes TWO to tango, and in this case it takes TWO to sing as well. Together since birth, these Fire Monsters have a great knack for communication (usually one telling the other what TWO do). With the diminutive Emperor Bisonorus atop the burly Standard Bisonorus, they are unstoppably fearless - except that one time when the latter had to crisis-manage the former's dignity after an unusual wardrobe malfunction involving some possibly imaginary clothes. With each supporting the other, they always seem to have can-TWO attitudes.",
