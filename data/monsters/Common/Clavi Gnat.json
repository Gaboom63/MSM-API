    "description": "Clavi Gnats produce their signature grooves by tapping the spherical sacs of the Clavi Creeper - the sprawling plant where they make their home. It's hard to tell whether the insectoid Monster enjoys its music-making thanks to its jumbled-up face, but make no mistake: upside down or rightside up, that doesn't change the fact that the Clavi Gnat is a hard worker, and one of the most reliable friends to hatch this side of the leaf.",
