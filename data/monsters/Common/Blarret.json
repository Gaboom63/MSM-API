    "description": "Right after it's synthesized, the Ethereal Blarret only has one functioning mouth: the top one attached to the rest of its face. Once it's a little older, the Monster's secondary and tertiary mouths learn to sing with preternatural speed… although a non-trivial amount of discipline and concentration is required to make sure they all sing in the right order. After a while though, the reflex becomes 'otama-tic.' Blarrets love getting their triple chins scratched by an Auglur's digital claws - although in the case of the two lower mouths, it's more like a neck scratch?",
