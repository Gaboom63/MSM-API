    "description": "In keeping with the biology of their coiffed-calved relatives, Roobas consume a holistic plant-based diet that not only gives them a lush green hue, but also a foliage-like consistency to their furthered body - and even accelerated hair growth! This naturalistic Monster will be happy to open your mind to a wild world of vegetation, from its fondness for fronds to its soft spot for sprouts. Just make sure to check for stray hairs before dining!",
