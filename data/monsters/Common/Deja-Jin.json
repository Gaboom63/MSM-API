    "description": "If you have the sudden, nagging suspicion that you're experiencing something you've seen or heard of before, it could be that you're in the vicinity of Déjà-Jin! Some traits of the levitating Psychic-Faerie hybrid, like its guttural voice and colorful crystal array, may remind some of more established species elsewhere in the Monster World. However, what makes the Déjà-Jin totally unique is the piezoelectric charge coursing through its horns, and which is responsible for the disorienting psychic effect it has on others.",
