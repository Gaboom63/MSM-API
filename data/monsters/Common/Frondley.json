    "description": "When traipsing through a grove of trees in the pocket dimension, take care where you're stepping - you wouldn't want to tread on any of the root-toes of the Frondley! Its long strands of 'hair' dangle down from the top of its wasp-waisted body, making it difficult to recognize quickly. There's no mistaking it when it begins to hum, though - a glowing eye, psycho-static energy coursing through its hair and an surreal aura of warmth and friendship are enough to get anyone's attention!",
