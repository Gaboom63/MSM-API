    "description": "A flock of colorful birds plucking the instrument of a willing little Monster? It may sound familiar, yet the Peckidna evolved independently of the woolen Monster you know and love thanks to its unique habitat and Elemental make-up. The caring Peckidna crawls beneath the bellies of itchy-tummied giants and uses its spines to scritch and scratch away. Its shell not only provides a cozy place to get some 'me time,' but also a layer of protection from any flaky skin that may fall from the Monster above!",
