    "description": "For an Element with strong ties to forward-thinking concepts like rebirth and renewal, the adult Blasoom sure spends a lot of time thinking about the past. Specifically, the Plant Celestial fancies itself an aficionado of something called the Middle C Ages (no one's sure what that's in reference to). Its enthusiasm as a history buff knows no limits; it styles its growing facial ferns to resemble ancient heaumes (though it must be hard to see where you're going) and even organizes 'Renna-sawnts' fairs to march around at (one leg at a time).",
