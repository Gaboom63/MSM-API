    "description": "Ever cross a rickety old bridge and feel like something is waiting for you underneath? It was probably just a Bridg-it! This tender soul loves hosting guests for tea, served just how they like it, in a tasse balanced delicately on its length digits. Following tea, guests are invited to sit back and enjoy the Bridg-it's exquisite 'chinstrument' as their host taps a tinkling little tune that would make any visitor feel special. What a treat!",
