    "name": "Bowhead",
    "description": "One of the deepest-diving denizens of the living ocean, the majestic Bowhead breaches above the surface and harnesses miraculous ocean currents to levitate ashore and show everyone a whale of a time. By listening closely to the low-pitched, infrasonic sounds echoing along these currents, this Quint-Element Monster memorizes and masters their resonant melodies. Gliding tubercled flippers across its baleen, the Bowhead produces superb, euphonious bass and always gives a 'kriller' performance! It's believed that some of the Water Top Boss's most identifiable traits are also expressed in a land-dwelling cousin.",
