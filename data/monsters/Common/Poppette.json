    "description": "Poppette's shiny bubbles may look ready to pop, but be forewarned: this Monster is tougher than a lead balloon! No matter how hard you pinch and poke, the unpoppable Poppette will withstand your efforts. Years of constant prodding have made this once-bubbly Monster more hardened than chewed bubblegum - or bubbledrum, if you will.",
