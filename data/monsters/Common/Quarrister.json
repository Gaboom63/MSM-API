    "description": "The first stage of the Quarrister's life cycle begins deep underground. Each head is a separate creature, feeding on crystals and fending for themselves. Eventually, groups of heads band together and harmonize their efforts until they physically fuse together. Every once in a while, one of the Quarrister's voices will go for a solo, but that kind of behavior is usually seen as big-headed.",
