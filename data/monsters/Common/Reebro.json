    "description": "Of all the creatures known in the multiverse, the Reebro is right up there with the strangest. Little more than an oversized brain to begin with, this Ethereal beast develops a mechanical body using its instinctual technological know-how. The Reebro, or simply 'Bro' as it is affectionately called by its fellow Monsters, is a laid-back character who lives for fun and has the scoop on all the latest trends. It's always willing to assist others with their 'Mech'-nical difficulties - even if its go-to solution is to 'turn it off and then turn it on again.'",
