    "description": "While it's no stranger to stringed instruments, the Shugabeats has always had a closer affinity to the rhythm selection. An accomplished gardener, it cultivates and sustains a living drumkit made of different types of mushrooms. When struck, the cymbal-shrooms release a fine amber powder, which is why so many Shugabeats' beards are tinted likewise.",
