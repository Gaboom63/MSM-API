    "description": "The Maggpi is nimble of both voice and of mind, with a vocal range spanning the most silvery of sopranos to the most full-bodied of contraltos - and a brain like a steel trap. Although fastidious and well-coiffed, the Maggpi's otherwise silky fur is often matted due to getting hugged so much: such is the burden of one so beloved. Its eyelashes are long and lush and create its own breeze when it blinks.",
