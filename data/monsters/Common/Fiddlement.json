    "description": "Fiddlements are powered by the very Element of Light itself, releasing huge amounts of incandescent energy through the filaments of their cranial bulbs. The intense amplitude of light waves creates a unique whirring sound within the bulb, which Fiddlements use to express themselves. Serendipitously, the lampshade-like cone created by a Fiddlement's body channels its raw luminescence like a spotlight, which this bright little Monster gladly shines on solo performances, late-night walks to the fridge, and potholes in need of repair",
