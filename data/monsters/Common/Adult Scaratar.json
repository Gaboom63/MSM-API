    "name": "Adult Scaratar",
    "description": "No longer forced to lay its trademark instrument on the ground, the Scaratar fastidiously infuses wood with special toxins that transform it into a more ornate version. At this age, the Celestial of Poison is perhaps a little too preoccupied with superficially being an indicator of quality, and will often fixate on polishing its instrument rather than practicing its arpeggios.",
