    "description": "Even more so than its mandolin-toting cousin, the Shugavox loves to wail out a wild tune in the company of its Monster brethren. It and the Shugabush enjoy a friendly rivalry for pretty much everything, including their tastes in phay-door-uhs. To make itself stand out more, the Shugavox regularly mists itself with essence of Deedge earwax to color itself blue.",
