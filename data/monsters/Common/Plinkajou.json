    "description": "The daring Plinkajou will risk life and limb in the paleontological pursuit of osseous treasures. Its play-hensile tail gives it the agility it needs to climb the tallest boulders and cling to crumbling cliff sides without fear. Not once has a Plinkajou been caught losing its footing! Instead, it descends to its ground-level den of its own accord for playtime, when it bats at its favorite fossilized findings to make tinkling little tunes.",
